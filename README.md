# House Price Prediction

This project involves predicting house prices in California using a variety of machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as location, number of rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean. The project employs feature engineering, data preprocessing, and multiple regression models to achieve accurate predictions.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models for predicting house prices. It covers:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering and preprocessing
- Regression techniques including Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor
- Model evaluation and optimization

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **California Housing Dataset**, which includes the following features:
- `longitude` and `latitude`: Geographical coordinates of the houses
- `ocean_proximity`: Categorical feature indicating the proximity of the house to the ocean
- `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`: Counts of rooms and bedrooms
- `population`, `households`: Population and household counts in the area
- `median_house_value`: The target variable representing the house price

---

## Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:
1. Handling missing values: Rows with null values in the `total_bedrooms` column were removed.
2. Encoding categorical data: The `ocean_proximity` feature was encoded using LabelEncoder.
3. Feature scaling: Log transformations and scalers (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler) were used to normalize skewed data.

---

## Feature Engineering

New features were derived to improve the model's performance:
- **Bedrooms per Room**: Ratio of bedrooms to total rooms.

Visualizations such as histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps were created to explore relationships between features and the target variable.

---

## Modeling

### Models Used
- **Linear Regression**: Applied with MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler for normalization.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Trained and evaluated using hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Parameters for the Random Forest model were optimized using a grid search, which included:
- `n_estimators`: Number of trees
- `max_features`: Number of features considered for splitting
- `min_samples_split`: Minimum samples required to split an internal node

---

## Results

- **Linear Regression (StandardScaler)**:
  - Training Score: `0.6654458830589657`
  - Test Score: `0.6633157663844678`
- **Random Forest Regressor**:
  - Test Score: `0.8169850534542374`

The results showed that Random Forest achieved a better score compared to Linear Regression.
